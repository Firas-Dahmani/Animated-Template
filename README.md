# [Animated Template](https://firas-dahmani.github.io/Animated-Template/)

This project used a template website, and through the class, we added animations to the website on scroll.

## Thoughts

This project was mostly about learning the Animate On Scroll library. I remember I had a past project I tried to do an animate on scroll on my own but couldn't figure it out. This [library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) would have come in handy back then.
